## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Atom, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Atom otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an Atom command, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Include details about your configuration and environment** What's the name and version of the OS you're usin.

### Suggesting Enhancements

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Atom which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast)

### Issue Closure

Bug reports will be closed if the issue has been inactive and the latest affected version no longer receives support. 
_If an issue has been closed and you still feel it's relevant, feel free to ping a maintainer or add a comment!_

### Languages

We accept issues in *any* language.
When an issue is posted in a language besides English, it is acceptable and encouraged to post an English-translated copy as a reply.
Anyone may post the translated reply.
In most cases, a quick pass through translation software is sufficient.
Having the original text _as well as_ the translation can help mitigate translation errors.

Responses to posted issues may or may not be in the original language.
